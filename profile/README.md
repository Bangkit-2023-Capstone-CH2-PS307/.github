  <p>A Stunting-Free Future Starts with Every Meal</p>

# About this project
Stunting is a serious problem that has been occurring for a long time in Indonesia. As of 2023, it is known that the number of stunting in Indonesia is reaching 21.6% based on the Status Gizi Indonesia/SSGI carried out by the Ministry of Health in 2023. While there's been a decrease from 24.4% in 2021, it's still far from the national target of 14% and below.

Steps to prevent stunting implemented by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia include meeting nutritional needs since pregnancy. This action is relatively effective because the Millennium Challenge Health Institute in the Ministry of Health's report recommends that pregnant women always consume healthy and nutritious food and supplementation. The mother's nutritional needs will increase during pregnancy to support fetal growth. Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women's energy requirements increase 13% with protein requirements 54% higher during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Dewey, 2016).
